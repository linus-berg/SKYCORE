# SKYCORE

Skycore assembles operators and required images to run core services in an airgapped cloud (K8s) environment as a single GitHub release.

All operators / services are tested and evaluated against a running K8S cluster to ensure correct versions and all required images.

Run `get-cluster-images.sh` to check images running in a cluster.
